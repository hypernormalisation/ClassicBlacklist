[![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Hypernormalisation/Scambuster/total?logo=github&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Hypernormalisation/Scambuster/releases/latest)

An addon and framework for alerting the user when they encounter a known scammer in WoW WotLK Classic.

Works by packaging scammer lists curated by trusted sources like Realm Discords, and is extensible so communities can tailor their own blocklists and extend Scambuster with them.

## Getting Started

### Install

To start using Scambuster, install the base addon and a provider extension.

### Configure

To configure Scambuster, check your Interface addon options, or type one of the following slashcommands into your chat bar in-game:
- `/sb`
- `/scambuster`
