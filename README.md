# Cutpurse

![cutpurse_logo1.png](./media/cutpurse_logo1.png)

An addon and framework for alerting the user when they encounter a known scammer in WoW Classic.

Supports user blocklists, customisable alarms, group/raid/guild broadcasts that a known scammer is present.

Works by packaging scammer lists curated by trusted sources like Realm Discords, and is extensible so communities can tailor their own blocklists and extend Cutpurse with them.
