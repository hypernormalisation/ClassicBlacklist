## [0.1.7] - 2024-05-04

### Changed
- .toc files for Cata and SoD versions of wow included. Interface versions bumped accordingly.

## [0.1.6] - 2023-04-08

### Fixed
- The last_seen and last_alerted timestamps were incorrectly using the time the computer has been active. They now use the epoch time, which should fix an issue where alerts were not generated when they should have been.
- Fixed and issue with name-only matched alert generations that was causing lua errors where a GUID was not present in the case data.

## [0.1.5] - 2023-01-25

### Fixed
- Prevented an error where GetPlayerInfoByGUID endpoint was returning nil for name or realm. Needs a proper fix at some point to schedule a retry, but this will prevent lua errors arising.
- Fixed an error that was spamming provider name mismatches each time a name-mismatched player was encountered, instead of just once per scammer rename.

## [0.1.4] - 2023-01-19

### Changed
- Interface number updated for Ulduar patch 3.4.1, to reflect the addon is up-to-date and functional in this game version.

### Fixed
- Applied a fix for an issue where the realm name occasionally is returned by the WoW API as nil, which was causing that particular scan attempt to fail.

## [0.1.3] - 2023-01-17

### Changed
- Now the only scans that can result in a group broadcast are groups scans. All other scans now go to system messages when in a group to prevent spamming groups.

## [0.1.2] - 2023-01-17

### Fixed
- Removed a debug print when player is invited to group.

## [0.1.1] - 2023-01-16

Initial release.
