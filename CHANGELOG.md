## [0.1.5] - 2023-01-25

### Fixed
- Prevented an error where GetPlayerInfoByGUID endpoint was returning nil for name or realm. Needs a proper fix at some point to schedule a retry, but this will prevent lua errors arising.
- Fixed an error that was spamming provider name mismatches each time a name-mismatched player was encountered, instead of just once per scammer rename.

## [0.1.4] - 2023-01-19

### Changed
- Interface number updated for Ulduar patch 3.4.1, to reflect the addon is up-to-date and functional in this game version.

### Fixed
- Applied a fix for an issue where the realm name occasionally is returned by the WoW API as nil, which was causing that particular scan attempt to fail.

## [0.1.3] - 2023-01-17

### Changed
- Now the only scans that can result in a group broadcast are groups scans. All other scans now go to system messages when in a group to prevent spamming groups.

## [0.1.2] - 2023-01-17

### Fixed
- Removed a debug print when player is invited to group.

## [0.1.1] - 2023-01-16

Initial release.
